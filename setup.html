                    In the first half of this course, our goal is to make a contribution to the Linux Kernel. One may say that's an ambicious goal for students who have just entered the world of free software. Well, I agree! But our hope is that working step by step and with the help of more experienced people, that's a challenge within reach! Thankfully we are well accompained by Jo√£o Paulo Pereira, David Tadokoro, Professor Paulo Meirelles, Marcelo Schimidt and a few other more experienced developers, who have greatly helped so far.

                    In the first 3 weeks of the course we followed the tutorials made by FLUSP - the free software community at USP and learned about the basics of the free software philosophy and history as well as the basic setup for building the kernel and its modules. We also learned about the process of making a patch and sending it to be reviewed by the community. In this post, I will summarize some of that experience and what some of the biggest challenges and learnings so far.

                <p>Work in progress!</p>
