                    Goal number 1
                </h2>
                <p class="bv mt-3 pt-3">
                    In the first half of this course, our goal is to make a contribution to the Linux Kernel. The linux Kernel is the piece of software behind every operating system based on Linux. The computer I am writing this on is running on linux and the server that sent you this blog post likely runs on linux as well. In fact, computers all over the world run on Linux and, therefore use the linux Kernel. So making changes to such an important system seems like an ambitious goal for students who have just entered the world of free software, doesn’t it?
                </p>
                <p class="bv mt-3">
                    Well, I agree! That was my first thought as well. But luckily, we’re well accompanied. To teach us and guide us on the next steps we have the company of students and professors from FLUSP - the free software community at USP - as well as the help from USP’s alumni who currently work with this kind of development.
                </p>

                <p class="bv mt-3">
                    Our goal is not to some big change that will completely revolutionize the kernel (not yet anyways! :D). We will likely make a minor change to a code that already works, in order to make it more readable, to make it up-to-date with the style-guide the community has chosen, or to apply some improvement that someone has already spotted and applied in some other part of the system.
                </p>
                <p class="bv mt-3">
                    The idea is to explore and understand the whole process of contributing to an open source software, from finding a improvement, to downloading and changing the code, until finally submitting a patch (a suggestion of change).
                </p>

                <p class="bv mt-3">
                    Since the Kernel is millions of lines long we have chosen to work with an specific portion of it, one that our mentors have experience with. We will work on the IIO subsystem - the Industrial Input and Output subsystem. That part of the Kernel has software to configure the capture of information from sensors other devices as well as the output of information on LED’s, screens and similar devices.
                </p>

                <h2 class="montserrat-bold">Goal number 2</h2>
                <p class="bv mt-3">
                    Having worked if the Kernel for a while, in the second half of the discipline, we will work in pairs and chose an open source project to contribute to. That can be the Kernel again, the Kworkflow (a software proposed by former USP students to help contribute to the Kernel), or another project of our choice. Otavio Silva and I have yet to decide what we will work on. But I am confident that after contributing to the kernel, we will be prepared to work on other projects.
                </p>
                <h2 class="montserrat-bold">Conclusion and next steps</h2>
                <p class="bv mt-3 pb-5">
                    Now that we have a plan, is time to start working. The next step is to download the code from the Kernel, understand the subsystem we will work on, and learn to build, deploy and run the Kernel!
