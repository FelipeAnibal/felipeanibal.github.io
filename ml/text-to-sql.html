                <p>
                    In the past few months, I have dedicated myself to study machine learning and decided to write about some of it here. In the meantime, an opportunity arose to work on a hands-on project and apply some of what I've learned—and learn much more in the process!
                    <span class="highlight-blue">For the next few months, I will be research assistant in a project that involves generating database queries from sentences in Portuguese, an application of a topic often called text-to-SQL translation. More specifically, I'll be working on data augmentation techniques for models that perform text-to-SQL translation.</span>
                </p>

                <h2>What is Text-to-SQL Translation?</h2>

                <p>
                    Imagine researchers have collected large volumes of data about public schools in Brazil. The dataset includes invaluable information such as the schools' locations, the size of their facilities, the number of enrolled students, the resources available at each school, and so on. This data can be extremely useful for policymaking, helping answer questions like, "How many schools have access to computers?", "Which cities have no schools?", or "What is the average number of students in schools in Feira de Santana?". With some programming, these questions could be answered easily. <span class="highlight-blue">But what if a system could be built that answered these questions without the need for programming? This is where text-to-SQL comes in</span>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Text-to-SQL refers to a set of techniques aimed at translating questions in natural language (NL)—a language spoken by humans—into Structured Query Language (SQL), which is used by programmers to retrieve data from a database.
                </p>

                <h2>What Are Some of the Challenges of Text-to-SQL?</h2>

                <p>
                    Text-to-SQL translation has evolved significantly in the past five years. The advent of large language models (LLMs) like GPT has had a major impact on the field. However, some challenges remain! <span class="highlight-blue">Considering the nature of the problem itself, there are challenges related to understanding the NL input and producing the correct SQL output</span>. Here are some challenges highlighted in the 2023 survey by George Katsogiannis-Meimarakis and Georgia Koutrika<a class="reference" href="#ref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    <strong>Natural Language Challenges:</strong>
                </p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Lexical Ambiguity:</strong> Words can have multiple meanings depending on the context. For example, "Paris" could refer to the city or to a person's name. The system must resolve these ambiguities to generate accurate SQL queries.</li>
                
                    <li><strong>Syntactic Ambiguity:</strong> Sentences may have multiple interpretations based on structure. For instance, the question "Find all German movie directors" could refer to German directors or to German-language movies, which leads to different SQL outputs.</li>
                
                    <li><strong>Semantic Ambiguity:</strong> A sentence can carry different meanings. For example, the query "Are Brad and Angelina married?" could be asking if they are married to each other or to other people.</li>
                
                    <li><strong>Context-dependent Ambiguity:</strong> Words like "top" or "best" are context-sensitive. In a query like "Who was the best runner of the marathon?", it may refer to the fastest runner, but in another context, "best" could mean the one with the most medals.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>
                    <strong>SQL Challenges:</strong>
                </p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>SQL Syntax Complexity:</strong> SQL has a strict syntax and lacks the expressiveness of natural language. This often results in complex SQL queries for seemingly simple questions, like those involving nested queries or multiple joins.</li>
                
                    <li><strong>Database Structure Mismatch:</strong> The way users think about data often differs from the database schema. For example, a user might ask for "actresses," but the database might use the term "actor" for both genders, which could cause issues when generating the correct SQL query.</li>
                
                    <li><strong>Handling Implicit Joins:</strong> Many user queries involve implicit relationships between tables. For example, asking "Who directed the movie 'A Beautiful Mind'?" might require joining several tables in the database, which the system must handle correctly.</li>
                
                    <li><strong>Entity Modeling:</strong> How entities are modeled in a database can vary greatly. For instance, querying students in a university database differs from querying movie genres in a film database, as some entities are stored across multiple tables, while others are modeled in many-to-many relationships.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>What is Data Augmentation?</h2>

                <p>
                    Many models have been developed to address the problems mentioned above. Some of the best-performing algorithms today involve machine learning and large language models (LLMs). These strategies essentially "train" computers to learn from examples. Researchers create models that are fed with database schemas (or even entire databases) and a series of pairs of NL questions with corresponding SQL queries. The models then "learn" from this data and are able to predict the best "translation" of a NL question into a SQL query.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="highlight-blue">These Machine Learning Models require large volumes of data!</span> Thankfully, alongside the significant technical advances in machine learning algorithms, the amount of available data has increased dramatically in recent years. Datasets called benchmarks have been created and published with the specific purpose of training and evaluating text-to-SQL models. Some of the most well-known benchmarks are BIRD<a href="ref4"><sup>4</sup></a> and Spider<a href="ref5">5</a>, and they allowed great progress in the field.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="highlight-blue">However, building accurate and diverse datasets is costly, and the datasets we have still have limitations. Researchers Karina Fróes<a href="#ref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and Diego Lopes<a href="#ref3"><sup>3</sup></a> highlight that temporal and geospatial queries, for example, are still underrepresented in datasets for text-to-SQL applications. Additionally, when working with languages other than English, we have very limited data. The lack of training data in these cases hinders the development of robust and accurate models.</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    To address these limitations, data augmentation is often explored as a technique, and it will be the focus of my research in the coming months. <span class="highlight-blue">The goal of data augmentation is to generate synthetic data that can be used alongside real data to improve a model's performance.</span> Data augmentation is widely used in other ML fields like image processing and computer vision, and it has shown promising results in the context of text-to-SQL as well.
                </p>

                <h2>Next Steps</h2>

                <p>
                    In the coming months, I plan to explore data augmentation for text-to-SQL translation. <span class="highlight-blue">The goal of this research project is to explore different data augmentation techniques, understand their impact, and use them to produce better models for the Portuguese language. </span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    My research will assist Karina Fróes<a href="#ref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and Diego Lopes<a href="#ref3"><sup>3</sup></a> in their work on temporal and geospatial text-to-SQL translation, and I will be mentored by Professor Kelly Braghetto. As a case of study, we will apply the techiniques we learn on datasets from the CulturaEduca platform, which contains data on culture and education in Brazil.
                </p>
